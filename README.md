# Shared Meal Finder

Live: [Click Here](https://www.henry-pan.com/fe3h-meals/)

A simple webapp to help pick a meal in the game Fire Emblem: Three Houses (FE3H).

In FE3H, the player can dine with two characters among students and faculty in the dining hall to build support. Each character has meals they like, and it is optimal to pick a meal that both characters enjoy. However, it's tedious to discover which meals are mutually liked, so I created this webapp.
