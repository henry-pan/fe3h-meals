# Fire Emblem: Three Houses - Shared Meal Finder

Live: [Click Here](https://www.henry-pan.com/fe3h-meals/)

A simple webapp to help pick a meal in the game Fire Emblem: Three Houses (FE3H).

In FE3H, the player can dine with two characters among students and faculty in the dining hall to build support. Each character have meals they like, and it is optimal to pick a meal that both characters enjoy. However, it is tedious to discover which meals are mutually liked, especially with cross-house students, so I created this webapp.

Additionally, the app will also display possible supports for any given character.

## Usage

Simply click the checkboxes for two characters and the webapp will display the list of meals that both characters like.

Selecting a character will display an icon next to every character that the selected character can support.

## Built With
